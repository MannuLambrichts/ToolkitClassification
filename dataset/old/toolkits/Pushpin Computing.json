	"notes": "A hardware and software platform has been designed and implemented for modeling, testing, and deploying distributed peer-to-peer sensor networks comprised of many identical nodes. Each node possesses the tangible affordances of a commonplace pushpin to meet ease-of-use and power considerations. The sensing, computational, and communication abilities of a “Pushpin”, as well as a “Pushpin” operating system supporting mobile computational processes are treated in detail. Example applications and future work are discussed.",
