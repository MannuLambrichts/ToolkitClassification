----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROCK64 is a credit card sized Single Board Computer powered by Rockchip RK3328 Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit Processor and support up to 4GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 memory. It provides an eMMC module socket, MicroSD Card slot, Pi-2 Bus, Pi-P5+ Bus, USB 3.0 and many others peripheral devices interface for makers to integrate with sensors and devices.
Various Operating Systems are made available by open source community and partner projects including numerous Linux Distributions, Android,  *BSD and many more to come.

PINE A64(+) Our First 64-bit Single Board Computer
---------------------------------------------------------
This is where our journey began. The PINE A64 (+) is our first Single Board Computer powered by Allwinnerâ€™s A64 Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 64-Bit SOC. There are many Operating Systems available for the PINE A64 (+) created by the open source community and various partner projects. Currently the majority of Linux distributions for the PINE A64 are using mainline Linux but there are a number of BSP-based distribution and / or legacy systems that you can download too.
Apart from Linux, you also have a choice of a selection of *BSDs, Android, Remix OS and Windows IoT.",
