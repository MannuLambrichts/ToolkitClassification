	"notes": "We describe work in progress on roBlocks, a computational construction kit that encourages users to experiment and play with a collection of sensor, logic and actuator blocks, exposing them to a variety of advanced concepts including kinematics, feedback and distributed control. Its interface presents novice users with a simple, tangible set of robotic blocks, whereas advanced users work with software tools to analyze and rewrite the programs embedded in each block. Early results suggest that roBlocks may be an effective vehicle to expose young people to complex ideas in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.

Cubelets are the only toy that uses Tactile Coding to help builders of nearly any age explore robotics, coding, and more. Uniquely designed, they are little bundles of software inside little bundles of hardware. As you build a robot, you learn to build a program. Itâ€™s a fun and fascinating way to introduce big ideas through play.",
