	"notes": "You may have noticed that starting in 2018, a lot of Adafruit development boards have connectors that look like this:

We call these STEMMA connectors - technically they are called 3 and 4 pin JST PH connectors. They're our way of making it easy to plug-n-play various sensors and devices without a lot of wiring. Especially when the board isn't breadboard-friendly, as above.

The idea is that by having easy-to-plug cables, you can wire up things without soldering, wiring and complexity. For example, here's a STEMMA soil sensor.",
