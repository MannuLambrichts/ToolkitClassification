Cubit’s dynamic learning activities enable students and their families to build science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) knowledge and skills at home through self-directed lessons that challenge, inspire, and engage young learners and adults alike. Our user-friendly platform and guided lessons are designed to be used by anyone at any skill level, whether you have experience with programming or robotics, or not. We believe everyone has the ability to become the next great inventor! Cubit makes it easy—and FUN—to understand and master STEAM concepts.",
