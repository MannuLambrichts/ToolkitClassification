	"notes": "The micro:bit is a tiny computer that makes coding tangible and promotes digital creativity.

You create a program to tell it what to do using one of the online code editors, and download it to your computer as a .hex file - a version of your program that your micro:bit can read.

Two modes of use: (a) with 3rd party accessories that the micro:bit plugs into (only one at a time) and (b) with direct wiring to custom circuits either via breakout board or using croc clips.",
