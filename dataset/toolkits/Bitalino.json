	"notes": "Physical computing has spun a true global revolution in the way that the digital world now interfaces with the physical one. From Twitter-controlled Christmas trees to bicycle jackets with turn signal lights, the do-it-yourself movement is driving endless innovations and stimulating an age of creative engineering. The authors present a novel development platform that extends the principles of physical computing to the physiological domain, changing the way in which projects and applications involving physiological data can be made.",
