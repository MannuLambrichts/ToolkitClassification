	"notes": "The Argon is a powerful Wi-Fi enabled development board that can act as a standalone Wi-Fi endpoint. It is based on the Nordic nRF52840 and has built-in battery charging circuitry so itâ€™s easy to connect a Li-Po and deploy your local network in minutes.

The Argon is great for connecting projects to the Particle Device Cloud or as a gateway to connect an entire group of local endpoints.  It's everything you love about the Photon, with more features like Bluetooth.",
