	"notes": "We introduce a new concept of networking objects in everyday environments. The basic idea is to build on the familiar use of surfaces such as walls and boards for attachment of mundane objects such as light controls, pictures, and notes. Hence our networking concept entails augmentation of such surfaces with conductive material to enable them as communication medium. It further incorporates the use of simple pushpin-connectors through which objects can be attached to network-enabled surfaces. Thereby users are provided with a highly familiar mechanism for adding objects ad hoc to the bus network, hence its name Pin&Play. This paper describes the architecture and principles of Pin&Play, as well as the design and implementation of a smart notice-board as proof of concept.",
